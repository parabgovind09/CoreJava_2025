/*
Java, Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). 
It is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class. 
In Java, Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones. 
A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class. 
In addition, you can add new fields and methods to your current class as well.

Inheritance is one of the fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. 
It allows a child class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class (superclass). 
This enables code reusability, hierarchical classification, and method overriding.

ðŸ”¹ What is Inheritance?
Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties and behaviors of another class.
It eliminates code duplication and promotes reusability.

ðŸ”¹ Key Benefits:
âœ… Code Reusability â€“ Avoid rewriting the same code multiple times.
âœ… Improved Maintainability â€“ Changes in the base class reflect in subclasses.
âœ… Extensibility â€“ New features can be added easily.
âœ… Supports Polymorphism â€“ Enables method overriding for dynamic method dispatch.

Why Java Doesn't Support Multiple Inheritance with Classes?
ðŸ”¹ Problem: Diamond Problem
If a class inherits from multiple classes, ambiguity arises if both parents have a method with the same name.

//Multiple inheritance through interface
//In Multiple inheritances, one class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes. 
//Please note that Java does not support multiple inheritances with classes. 
//In Java, we can achieve multiple inheritances only through Interfaces.
//Java does not allow multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity problems.

//Interface 1

}

//Interface 2
interface Two {
 void display();
}

//Class implementing both interfaces
//What If Both Interfaces Have the Same Method?
//âœ… The implementing class must override the method.
//Multiple Inheritance with Default Methods in Interfaces
//Java 8 introduced default methods in interfaces.
//ðŸ”¹ If two interfaces have the same default method, the implementing class must override it.
//âœ… If multiple interfaces have the same method, the implementing class must override it.

//Hybrid Inheritance in Java
//Hybrid Inheritance is a combination of Hierarchical and Multiple Inheritance.
//Java does not support Hybrid Inheritance directly due to Multiple Inheritance issues.
//âœ… Solution: Use Interfaces
//Hybrid Inheritance is a combination of multiple types of inheritance in a single program. 
//Since Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes, we achieve Hybrid Inheritance using interfaces.
